Documentary,État limite,"Things are busy at the Paris hospital where young psychiatrist Jamal and his colleagues work. The place is run down, the staff are exhausted, budgets are constantly being slashed. You know the story, but you’ve rarely seen it conveyed as engagingly as in ‘On the Edge’, which employs a handheld camera and meaningful, artistic interventions to observe the daily routine at the psychiatric ward.  The deeply sympathetic Jamal is an everyday hero with an exemplary, humanistic disposition, for whom the most important prerequisites for mental health – and for a healthy society in general – are good relationships with other people. He puts his philosophy into practice by listening patiently, giving good advice and organising theatre exercises based on Molière. Realism and idealism, however, are in balance for the young doctor, at least as long as the institutional framework holds up.",2023-03-18,0.795,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/lnRPuHjAi4WTQ4w09AK6OMw4dDR.jpg,93,Nicolas Peduzzi,État limite

"Drama, Action, Thriller",En plein feu,"Disaster movies tend to inhabit the close-but-not-too-close realm of the ‘what if?’, but Quentin Reynaud’s taut drama evokes a reality that is painfully immediate, as the world combusts around us. Alex Lutz (recently seen as the son in Gaspar Noé’s Vortex) plays a man determined to escape with his elderly father (the ineffable André Dussollier) from a wildfire that is rapidly approaching their forested area of southern France. The pair know all the local roads, and the secret detours, but when they are caught in a dead end, they seem to be running out of possible exits. At once road movie, claustrophobic jeopardy thriller and portrait of a prickly but tender father-son relationship, this finely acted and executed film expertly lays on the heat.",2023-03-08,2.017,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/phFNzjz4zifghYmCWwVWuWHqFEv.jpg,85,Quentin Reynaud,"Jour 37, En plein feu"

Documentary,Birds of America,"In the first half of the 19th century, the French ornithologist Jean-Jacques Audubon travelled to America to depict birdlife along the Mississippi River. Audubon was also a gifted painter. His life’s work in the form of the classic book ‘Birds of America’ is an invaluable documentation of both extinct species and an entire world of imagination. During the same period, early industrialisation and the expulsion of indigenous peoples was in full swing. The gorgeous film traces Audubon’s path around the South today. The displaced people’s descendants welcome us and retell history, while the deserted vistas of heavy industry stretch across the horizon. The magnificent, broad images in Jacques Loeuille’s atmospheric, modern adventure reminds us at the same time how little - and yet how much - is left of the nature that Audubon travelled around in. His paintings of the colourful birdlife of the South still belong to the most beautiful things you can imagine.",2022-05-25,0.793,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/f72SeQ2NYOJP0QdIrwY7thwfJaw.jpg,80,Jacques Loeuille,Birds of America

"Documentary, Animation",Fellini degli spiriti,"2020 marks 100 years since the birth of Federico Fellini, the most prominent Italian director and one of the symbols of the insuperable cinematic heyday of mid-20th century.

A great testimony to why rationalists and ideologists have a hard time with his work, ‘Fellini and the Spirits’ is an appropriate yet unexpected tribute.",2020-08-31,2.097,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/gMzrbkvXLTZ4jmWqXwYvL3oHsO8.jpg,90,Selma Dell'Olio,Fellini des esprits

Drama,À mort la mort !,"The idea for this film about a generation and its lost ideals came to Romain Goupil after attending several funerals of friends in the fall of 1996, where the '68 generation, now in influential positions in media or politics, kept meeting each other. It seemed as if the revolution that they had tried to make was being buried with each coffin. A MORT LA MORT is in some ways an homage to this generation, now in their fifties. They were a privileged generation that thought that they could change the world, doing everything that their parents failed to do. There were no actual deaths in France as there were in Germany or Italy, but the system was not ideal for personal issues or for love. There was always a scapegoat for the injustices of the world, be it capitalism or imperialism. That way the blame could be placed somewhere else. Some of the '68 generation are still faithful to the principles of their youth and still continue to fight for the illusions of the past.",1999-09-01,0.961,https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500https://image.tmdb.org/t/p/w500/yFfFdiaIsXDgZv9nyXrAleHyMh.jpg,90,Romain Goupil,À mort la mort!
